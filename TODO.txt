        API CALLS TO ADD
________________________________

**NOTE** -> On New Awardee --> When you create a Contact Object or Tryke object we should generate a random uuid as id for
each object that gets created.. I believe this will help out with some issues in the future


EditAwardee Page --> Edit Contact in Awardee.Contacts Array 
https://4ezbmsi1wg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/awardee/contact 

EditAwardee Page --> Edit Tryke in Awardee.Trykes Array 
https://4ezbmsi1wg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/awardee/tryke


============================================================
        
            TO DO
________________________________

Fix refresh on Update/Add Awardee --> Redirects back to view-awardee page and doesnt show the new/updated award right away
Omar had this fixed the other day.. Maybe settings got flipped back to default maybe we have to go back into AWS and
do the same thing we did again to fix it. 

Refactor Add/Edit awardee code -> Create components for MODAL's and FORMS

Add error checking for fields like phone number, zipcode
Choice which fields are required and what arent and how to handle

Add AUTH 

Add Permissions -> Only admins should see Users Tab -> Certain people should only be able to view an awardee not edit or Add awardee
 
Add pagination to View awardees page / Contacts / Trykes / Users pages

Refactor how were editing a contact or tryke I am using index <- we need to add an id field to this.contacts and this.Contacts
and find record by that uuid to edit and delete and so on.


================================================================



        CODE SUGGESTIONS
________________________________

Possibly add data fill in for adding a contact -> option to pull address from the awardee 
that is being craeted --> makes it nicer for the user.

For a Tryke do we want a city and state field for location awarded

Possibly change guardian type to dropdown in contacts 

///
Add field in database for error log

On each try catch in the catch send up error to API and store a list of every error that occurs

Create a small single page html vue app that just pulls all errors from API

This will help us or anyone dubug errors easier in PROD
