Possible Feature

Add field in database for error log

On each try catch in the catch send up error to API and store a list of every error that occurs

Create a small single page html vue app that just pulls all errors from API

This will help us or anyone dubug errors easier in PROD

================================================================

Add API call to edit user edit contact/tryke add contact/tryke delete contact/tryke 

Add error checking for fields like phone number, zipcode
Choice which fields are required and what arent

Decide how to EDIT a contact or tryke -> Send up entire awardee.contacts object to aws and replace that whole array of objects?

Add AUTH 

Add Permissions -> Only admins should see Users Tab -> Certain people should only be able to view an awardee not edit or Add awardee

On view Awardee page fix city search 
 
Possibly change guardian type to dropdown in contacts 

Add pagination to View awardees page / Contacts / Trykes / Users pages

Possibly add data fill in for adding a contact -> option to pull address from the awardee 
that is being craeted --> makes it nicer for the user.

For a Tryke do we want a city and state field for location awarded

Add contact add tryke to edit user

✓  Edit this.trykes | this.contacts in add and edit awardee to this.tryke and this.contacts

Refactor how were editing a contact or tryke I am using index <- we need to add an id field to this.contacts and this.Contacts
and find record by that uuid to edit and delete and so on.
