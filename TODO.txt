        API CALLS TO ADD
________________________________
**NOTE** -> Is AWS generating a uuid for each object in contacts array and each object in trykes array?
            If not should we generate it when we create a contact|tryke object?
            This would make it easier to find|edit|delete| in AWS so we dont have an index issue with multipe Users

============================================================
        
            TO DO
________________________________

Refactor Add/Edit awardee code -> Create components for MODAL's and FORMS

Add API call to edit user edit contact/tryke add contact/tryke delete contact/tryke 

Add error checking for fields like phone number, zipcode
Choice which fields are required and what arent

Decide how to EDIT a contact or tryke -> Send up entire awardee.contacts object to aws and replace that whole array of objects?

Add AUTH 

Add Permissions -> Only admins should see Users Tab -> Certain people should only be able to view an awardee not edit or Add awardee

On view Awardee page fix city search 
 
Add pagination to View awardees page / Contacts / Trykes / Users pages

Refactor how were editing a contact or tryke I am using index <- we need to add an id field to this.contacts and this.Contacts
and find record by that uuid to edit and delete and so on.

================================================================



        CODE SUGGESTIONS
________________________________

Possibly add data fill in for adding a contact -> option to pull address from the awardee 
that is being craeted --> makes it nicer for the user.

For a Tryke do we want a city and state field for location awarded

Possibly change guardian type to dropdown in contacts 

///
Add field in database for error log

On each try catch in the catch send up error to API and store a list of every error that occurs

Create a small single page html vue app that just pulls all errors from API

This will help us or anyone dubug errors easier in PROD
///
