3 ] Edit Awardee Page - Almost completed, needs major refactoring on how the tryke,contacts get edited/added/delete
                        - Should we change guardian type to be a dropdown in Contact?
                        - Set fields like zipcode,phone number, pa to desired data tables and character limits.

                        - Should we change guardian type to be a dropdown in Contact?

1 - HIGH
2 - MEDIUM
3 - LOW

2 ] Fix refresh on Update/Add Awardee --> Redirects back to view-awardee page and doesnt show the new/updated award right away
Omar had this fixed the other day.. Maybe settings got flipped back to default maybe we have to go back into AWS and
do the same thing we did again to fix it. 

2 ] Add AUTH - Build users pages 

2 ] Add Permissions -> Only admins should see Users Tab -> Certain people should only be able to view an awardee not edit or Add awardee

3 ] Refactor Add/Edit awardee code -> Create components for MODAL's and FORMS

                                                        CODE SUGGESTIONS
                                                ________________________________


Possibly add data fill in for adding a contact -> option to pull address from the awardee 
that is being craeted --> makes it nicer for the user.

For a Tryke do we want a city and state field for location awarded

Possibly change guardian type to dropdown in contacts 

GUIDO - Lambda may be able to instead of take hard-coded values as database fields, could 
just interpret data as it comes in from JSON object and construct UPDATE string, INSERT string 
on the fly.

Sort view awardees by timestamp when created - newests people should be at the top

///
Add field in database for error log

On each try catch in the catch send up error to API and store a list of every error that occurs

Create a small single page html vue app that just pulls all errors from API

This will help us or anyone dubug errors easier in PROD
