1 ] Edit Awardee Page - Almost completed, needs major refactoring on how the tryke,contacts get edited/added/delete
                        - What all fields for the form, tryke,contact do we want to be required?
                        - Should we change guardian type to be a dropdown in Contact?
                        - Set fields like zipcode,phone number, pa to desired data tables and character limits.
                        - **** When adding a Tryke|Contact to a pre existing awardee record we should be generating
                                 there object ids (client side). 
                                We will do this because after we add the object to AWS its not getting refetched on
                                the client side therefore the client side object isnt getting updated with the new id.
                                This poses concerns for updating/deleting if the user hasnt refreshed the page because
                                instead of refetching we are just storing the new record in a local array until
                                they refresh the page  ****
                        

2 ] View Awardee Page - Almost done, needs pagination added to the page
                        - Add pagination to the table


3 ] Add Awardee Page - Pretty much completed, needs small error including...
                        - What all fields for the form, tryke,contact do we want to be required?
                        - Should we change guardian type to be a dropdown in Contact?
                        - Set fields like zipcode,phone number, pa to desired data tables and character limits.
                        - **** When creating Tryke|Contact objects they should generate an id server side(AWS) ****

2 ] Fix refresh on Update/Add Awardee --> Redirects back to view-awardee page and doesnt show the new/updated award right away
Omar had this fixed the other day.. Maybe settings got flipped back to default maybe we have to go back into AWS and
do the same thing we did again to fix it. 

2 ] Add AUTH - Build users pages 

2 ] Add Permissions -> Only admins should see Users Tab -> Certain people should only be able to view an awardee not edit or Add awardee

3 ] Refactor Add/Edit awardee code -> Create components for MODAL's and FORMS

                                                        CODE SUGGESTIONS
                                                ________________________________


Possibly add data fill in for adding a contact -> option to pull address from the awardee 
that is being craeted --> makes it nicer for the user.

For a Tryke do we want a city and state field for location awarded

Possibly change guardian type to dropdown in contacts 

GUIDO - Lambda may be able to instead of take hard-coded values as database fields, could 
just interpret data as it comes in from JSON object and construct UPDATE string, INSERT string 
on the fly.

///
Add field in database for error log

On each try catch in the catch send up error to API and store a list of every error that occurs

Create a small single page html vue app that just pulls all errors from API

This will help us or anyone dubug errors easier in PROD
